# Bitcoin_prediction
An experiment to see if the ups and downs of bitcoin can be predicted using historical transactions data, Google searches and large account movements, or whether indeed the price is a random walk. This script pulls data from Kraken, Google Trends and BlockCypher, and tries an LSTM model using many lags. As of yet there is no useful predictive power from this data
